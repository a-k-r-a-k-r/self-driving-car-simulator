# self-driving-car-simulator
The core technology behind Self Driving Cars today. Given the image of a road at a time frame, it can decide where to turn the staring and how much. This is a temporary model. I am working continuously to improve the model and to generalize it to as many different terrains as possible.    
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the motion of the steering given the image of a road at a time.    
## However, some cool errors can be clearly seen with the current model in the demo.
